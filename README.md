### Well, How do I?

Simply clone the repo and run the "install" script in the directory of whatever OS you're running.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/RealFX-Code/dotfiles.git

# Check if you're running linux if you're unsure
$ uname -s
Linux

$ cd dotfiles/linux

$ chmod +x ./install*

$ ./install.sh

# OPTIONAL:
$ ./installSoftware.sh
```
