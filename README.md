### Well, How do I?

Simply clone the repo and run the "install" script in the directory of whatever OS you're running.

If you're on MacOS or Linux:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/RealFX-Code/dotfiles.git

$ cd dotfiles/$(uname -s)

$ chmod +x ./install*

$ ./install.sh

# OPTIONAL:
$ ./installSoftware.sh
```
